Code examples for different types of portrait ads...

- Standard (halfpage.html) has video and gallery content that opens in a left-side panel. Video is an mp4 file played using JWPlayer.

- YouTube (halfpage-youtube.html) is the same as above except the video opens a YouTube video in a fancybox overlay.

- eShop (halfpage-eshop.html) is a Nintendo version of the portrait ad.
