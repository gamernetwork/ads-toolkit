# Gamer Creative Preview Tool

This is a react application built to generate nicely presented, client facing static .html pages filled with creatives and takeovers from any given campaign.

The preview tool gets everything it needs from standard DFP urls, meaning that adding a new campaign to the tools is just a matter of copy and pasting a few links.

## Features

+ A reduced need to set up time consuming "test pages" for takeovers
+ A standardised format for presenting our work
+ Accessible interface that can be used by multiple departments
+ Instantaneous refreshing of takeover components (no more waiting 15 minutes for the damn thing to update)
+ A more reliable development process through quicker / easier testing
+ An easy to scan record of past campaigns

## Installation

+ git clone 
+ npm install (install dependancies)
+ npm run dev (start dev servers)
