# Takeover template

A slightly updated version of the old 'takeover skin code'. 

## New features

* Iframes within a takeover now communicate with each other, so everything is nice and synced up
on load (animations, display etc). This also means we can do some cross-iframe animations! 
* A few different classes for each site (eg 1260x250-leaderboard). 
* Some updated site-specific rules.
